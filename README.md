The project use the data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/niten19/face-shape-dataset
This dataset comprises a total of 5000 images of the female celebrities from all around the globe which are categorized according to their face-shape namely: Heart, Oblong, Oval, Round and Square
In this project, I train a model using the dataset above to detect a human face shape and deploy it through a flask app.
